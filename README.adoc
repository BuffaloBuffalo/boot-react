# Spring boot and react starter (for Java!)

This is a fork of geowarin's boot-react project which combines a a groovy based spring boot app with a react/flux front end.  The goal of this project is to eventually strip out all the non-essentials (e.g redis, spring security, other react dependencies) so that it is a true bootstrapping project.

Many thanks to Geowarin for his http://geowarin.github.io/spring-boot-and-react-hot.html[excellent blog post] and https://github.com/geowarin/boot-react[original repo]. Without either this wouldn't have been possible.


## The quick start for development

The project is split into two sub projects: backend and frontend.  `backend` is the spring boot java project, while `frontend` is the webpack-powered react proejct.  Both projects are built with gradle.  

First, setup npm dependencies in the react project:

```
./gradlew frontend:npmInstall
```

Then, start the backend project:

```
./gradlew backend:bootRun
```

Then, start the front end on a separate process
```
./gradlew frontend:start
```

You can also use `npm start` directly from the subproject if you wish.

Then, point your browser to localhost:3000

## How it works in Development
This bundled setup will start two local servers-- one which serves the spring-boot server side dynamic content, and one which serves the react app(s).  The React server has a proxy configured so that any requests to /api are proxied to localhost:8080 (e.g the spring boot server).  Any other requests are serverd by the static index.html content.


## How it works in production
When the application is built for standalone deployment, the backend project is configured to build the frontend project, and inclue the compiled assets into a JAR that is available on the classpath.  Spring is configured (in SinglePageAppConfig) to map static resources to the compiled asssets on the classpath.

# The rest


Be more productive than ever with this simple project that uses the https://spring.io/blog/2015/06/17/devtools-in-spring-boot-1-3[spring dev tools]
and https://github.com/gaearon/babel-plugin-react-transform[react transform] for hot reloading.

Everything from backend to frontend will automatically hot reload.

See http://geowarin.github.io/spring-boot-and-react-hot.html[my article] for an in-depth explanation.

This project also sets up spring security and http://projects.spring.io/spring-session/[spring-sessions], which will
automatically store your sessions in Redis, allowing you to scale on multiple servers.

Both the frontend and the backend are fully tested.

## Developing

The groovy code is available in the `backend` sub-project.
The `frontend` sub-project contains the javascript code.

First, install the npm dependencies:

```
./gradlew frontend:npmInstall
```

If you want to start both the frontend and the backend, the simplest is to use the `webpack` profile with the flag
`--spring.profiles.active=webpack`. This will automatically start the frontend dev-server along with the spring boot
application.

You can also run the frontend dev server separately with `./gradlew frontend:start` or with `npm start`.

In development you will have access to the awesome https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools[redux-dev-tools], which
will allow you keep track of your application state and undo/redo every action at will.

### Sessions

Sessions are stored in Redis with spring-sessions.
Spring-sessions allows you to transparently persist the HttpSession on Redis.
This allows to distribute the load on multiple servers if you choose to.

The application relies on a stateless REST api.
When they authenticate, clients will be given a token.
They will save this token in their local storage and send it as an HTTP header (`x-auth-token`).
This allows the retrieval of the session data in Redis.

If you want to use a real redis, you can run the application with the `redis` profile.

If you want to simulate the retrieval of http sessions through headers, use the `fake-redis` profile.
This will save the sessions in a simple map (useful in dev).

If you choose to run the application with neither of those profile, the application will fallback to classic http
sessions.

Summary:
|=== 
| Profile | description | uses `x-auth-token` header?

| <none>  | Use classic HTTPSessions | No. You won't be able to use the API with a REST client
| `redis` | Use a real redis connecting on localhost by default. | Yes
| `fake-redis` | Uses a map to store sessions | Yes
|===

### Security

The application is configured to work with Spring Security.
It uses an in-memory authentication but you are free use
http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.0.2.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#jc-authentication[other implementations]
or to http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.0.2.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#core-services[roll your own].

### Redux

This project uses https://github.com/rackt/react-redux[Redux] to handle state and actions.
It is a simple library with very powerful dev tools.

I suggest you read the https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/blob/master/docs/quick-start.md[redux quick start] to understand
how to architecture you application and the difference between smart and dumb components.

Since the application is small, every component is connected to redux and can be considered a "smart component".
Those are higher-order components, wrapped with the `connect()` method.

To be able to http://rackt.github.io/redux/docs/recipes/WritingTests.html[write tests] on smart components,
we need to work on the non-wrapped components. That is why we export both the connected component by default and the
non-connected component.

In the application we can import the connected component with `import Component from 'component'`.
In tests, we can `import {Component} from 'component'`.

### Router push state

The project uses https://github.com/rackt/react-router[react-router] to handle routes.
You can choose several modes to handles the router history.
By default, the project uses https://github.com/geowarin/boot-react/blob/master/frontend/src/config/history.js[the browser history],
which creates the nicest URLs (**/login**, **/private**, etc.).

In development you won't see much complexity since we use a dev server that
https://github.com/geowarin/boot-react/blob/master/frontend/server.js#L21-L24[proxies] requests to the index.
However, this leads to additional complexity once the frontend is deployed inside the jar.

There is a whole class that you can remove if you choose to use memory history (no URL change) or hash history
(**/\#/login**, **/#/private**): https://github.com/geowarin/boot-react/blob/master/backend/src/main/groovy/react/config/SinglePageAppConfig.groovy[SinglePageAppConfig]

## Running the tests


The check tasks will run the tests in both the frontend and the backend:
```
./gradlew check
```

You can run the backend/frontend tests only with:
```
./gradlew backend/frontend:test
```

To test the backend, we use a simple https://github.com/geowarin/spring-spock-mvc[library] that wraps
spring mvc test. It results in a better api for writing spock tests.
See the https://github.com/geowarin/boot-react/blob/master/backend/src/test/groovy/react/auth/AuthenticationSpec.groovy[auth-spec]
for an example.

To test the frontend, we use https://github.com/Legitcode/tests[legit-test] a simple library that
allows writing fluent tests for React components.

## Shipping

This command will generate an optimized bundle and include it in the jar.

```
./gradlew clean assemble
```

You can then launch it with:

```
java -jar build/libs/boot-react-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

With spring boot 1.3, you can install the application http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/deployment-install.html#deployment-service[as a linux service]

NB: each application can be assembled with the `assemble` task so you can use `frontend:assemble` or `backend:assemble`.
The backend task depends on the frontend task.

## Docker

The project can create a docker container.

Just run:

```
./gradlew backend:buildDocker
```

And it will create a docker image named `boot-react/boot-react`.

```
> docker images
REPOSITORY                               TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              VIRTUAL SIZE
boot-react/boot-react                    latest              5280d39f660f        About a minute ago   138.9 MB
```

You can then run it with:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 boot-react/boot-react
```

You can also pass arguments to the application like this:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 boot-react/boot-react --spring.profiles.active=redis --spring.redis.host=redis
```

## Docker-compose

There is a simple `docker-compose.yml` in the root directory of the project.
Once you have built the application image with `./gradlew backend:buildDocker`, you can run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will run the application together with a redis server.
